<p>I first came across what is, as far as I know, the unique copy of
<i>Magazine</i>, by G. W., when working in the library formed by the
late Sir Isaac Pitman.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a> It is bound up as the last item in a volume which
contains several nineteenth-century pamphlets on language and spelling,
and also the first numbers of the periodical <i>The Phonetic Friend</i>.
(The volume was for a time in the possession of the Bath City Free
Library, to which it was presented by Isaac Pitman; it must subsequently
have been returned to him.) I drew attention to the existence of
<i>Magazine</i> in an article published in 1937;<a class = "tag" name =
"tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> to the best of my knowledge it
had not been noticed in print before that, though it is of considerable
interest in a number of respects. I&nbsp;am indebted to Sir Isaac Pitman
&amp; Sons Ltd., London, for permission to reproduce the pamphlet
herewith in the Augustan Reprints.</p>

<p>G. W. was a spelling reformer, one of the many writers who, from
early Elizabethan times onwards, have been critical of traditional
English orthography and have made proposals for improving it. Although
nothing that could be called a spelling-reform “movement” existed until
the nineteenth century, there were earlier periods when the subject was
much in the air, when a number of people were writing about it and
reading and discussing each other’s ideas. The publication of
<i>Magazine</i> does not fall at one of these times; it comes, in fact,
in the very middle of a recession of interest in spelling reform which
lasted almost a hundred years. From about 1650 to 1750 there were few
critics of our orthography, and they were usually neither very strong in
their criticisms nor radical in their proposals for amendment.
G.&nbsp;W. is thus a somewhat isolated figure, and his scheme for reform
would appear, in its details at least, to be fairly original.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
The greater part of the pamphlet is given over to expounding the
illogicalities and inconsistencies of the established spelling, and here
G.&nbsp;W.’s style of writing, which is colloquial, racy and allusive,
is effective enough. It is not so well suited, however, to orderly and
clear exposition of his proposed amendment--unfortunately, since this is
what is likely to be of most interest to us today (and numerous
misprints increase the difficulties of grasping his proposals). Perhaps
there was, or was to have been, a&nbsp;sequel which would have stated
his reforms more systematically; that this may have been the case
appears from the statement on p.&nbsp;25 that the alphabet “is
preparing,” and from the mention, on the last page, of “the ensuing
Batl-dur” (i.e. battledore or hornbook). His remedy, briefly, is to
replace digraphs by new symbols: “more Letters would do well in the
Alfabet, but fewer in most words” (p.&nbsp;25); and, like John Hart
before him (whose works perhaps he knew) and Bernard Shaw after, he
draws attention to the economies to be gained from this: “if fewer
Letters will serve the turn, ’twill save Paper and Ink, and ’tis
strange, if not labour too” (p.&nbsp;5).</p>

<p>On p. 32 is exhibited “a compleat Alfebet” of 34 symbols (it is not
complete, for L has, apparently inadvertently, been omitted). Although
there is no indication there of the value each symbol should have, that
of most of them can be worked out, with some labor, from the rest of the
pamphlet (though a few must probably remain mysteries). I&nbsp;have
commented elsewhere<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href =
"#note3">3</a> on this scheme of reformed spelling; it appears to us
today to be theoretically quite creditable, at least as far as the
consonants are concerned. The traditional alphabet is enlarged by
providing a separate symbol for the italicized sounds in each of the
following words: <i>th</i>in <i>th</i>en <i>ch</i>urch <i>j</i>udge
<i>sh</i>all mea<i>s</i>ure <i>wh</i>en si<i>ng</i>; these symbols are
obtained partly by creating new ones, partly by redefining existing
letters. In two cases existing letters are redefined in
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
accordance with a rather odd principle&mdash;that the traditional
<i>name</i> of a letter must decide its value. Hence <i>h</i> is used to
spell <i>church</i> (which becomes “hurh”), and <i>g</i> is used to
spell <i>judge</i> (which becomes “gug”). This of course makes it
necessary for G.&nbsp;W. to include among his new symbols one for /h/
and one for /g/. The new symbols as used in the pamphlet are produced by
inverting or reversing existing letters; but these may possibly be
makeshifts, used in place of more ambitious shapes which were beyond the
reach of his printer; he suggests, for instance (p.&nbsp;20) “the sign
Taurus with a Foot-Ball between his horns” as one of his vowel symbols.
On the whole, we find the vowels much less systematically tackled than
the consonants, and it is proposed that accents (“cambrils”) should for
the most part be used to provide extra symbols; the pamphlet, however,
only exemplifies this sporadically.</p>

<p><i>Magazine</i> contains a considerable number of words, and a few
consecutive texts, transcribed partly or wholly in the new system of
spelling, and these necessarily will have to be assessed as evidence of
contemporary English pronunciation by students of the subject. It is not
easy to be sure how accurate a phonetic observer and transcriber
G.&nbsp;W. was, but if we make some allowance for misprints, we find a
certain consistency in his transcriptions, and an apparent freedom from
any bias given by the traditional spelling, which make one think he was
moderately reliable. In this connexion it is of some importance to find
out, if possible, where he came from. He shows familiarity both with
northern and western types of speech; but although he seems to imply, on
p.&nbsp;7, that he is not a North-countryman, E.&nbsp;J. Dobson has
found, on the basis of certain forms which appear in the pamphlet, that
there is a strong suggestion that he spoke a northern dialect.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a></p>

<p>Until recently I had been able to form no idea of the identity of
G.&nbsp;W. However, it new seems to be very possible that he was John
White, a
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
Devon schoolmaster, and author of <i>The Country-Man’s Conductor in
Reading and Writing True English</i>, which was published in Exeter in
1701.<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a>
The name John, in G.&nbsp;W.’s reformed spelling, would of course begin
with G (it is indeed so spelled on p.&nbsp;15). White was interested in
spelling reform, as we know from various remarks in his book; and if he
was G.&nbsp;W., it would explain the familiarity shown in
<i>Magazine</i> with western dialect. What is particularly striking,
moreover, is the similarity of White’s style to G.&nbsp;W.’s, as the
following quotations from <i>The Country-Man’s Conductor</i> will show:
of certain grammarians, “you shall seldom hear them speak Latin but in
Ale-Houses, or when they are well oil’d”; of specimens of early English,
“some may laugh at it, and thereby expose their rusty Teeth that will
look as old as the English”; of using an accent to show long vowels,
“this would look strange ’till it come in fashion, but in time would set
as tite as Topknots do now.”</p>

<p>One final resemblance must be mentioned. Whether or not White was
G.&nbsp;W., there can hardly be any doubt that <i>Magazine</i> was
printed by Samuel Farley of Exeter, the printer of White’s book. The
typographical similarity between <i>Magazine</i> and <i>The
Country-Man’s Conductor</i> (and other works printed by Farley) is too
complete to be coincidental. Not only are the identical fonts used, but
there are numerous other points where the general manner of printing is
the same.</p>

<p>Further research may confirm White’s authorship, but there is
certainly no other obvious candidate among the writers of the time.</p>

<p>But why should phrase be spell’d with ph and s, and not f and z?
Because you say its Original is a Greek word: But it hath been long
enough freely us’d amongst us, that it may claim prescription for a
Licence to put on the English garb, and suits pretty well with the
Original <span title = "[Greek] phrazô">φραζω</span>
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<span class = "folionum">A4</span>
and hath it not a single f in Greek? So might be frâz, and take with it
the Greek Precispomene, its right.</p>

<p>But if we spell praise thus, prayes we alter the sense. Why the Eyes
are as much in the dark to distinguish sound, as the Ears are put to
silence at the shape of Letters, and which of these is the fitter judge
in this Controversy, to bring knowledge to the Understanding? That is to
be observ’d well: But what’s Learnt in Childhood is uncontroulable, as
good as prescription of an hundred years, and a School-Dames authority
is irrefragable, as the Proverb says, <i>Early crookes the Tree, that
will good Cambrill be</i>: That to unlearn a Youthful Error, is more
than to serve an Apprentiseship, or take the Degree of a Doctor or
Serjeant. For these are deaf and dumb to Learn the contrary, as the dead
Letters they have Learn’d, though I am loath to compare them to the
English Doctor <i>Burnet</i>’s <i>Antidiluvian People</i> pettrify’d in
the Alps, which he saw in his Travails:</p>

<p>But in some parts they speak as we spell: Though the Countryman of
the <i>North</i> in Apron and Iron, pronounce o after r, and we before
it: Why should we keep their spelling, having lost their speech, and why
should they not still keep their spelling of old, who still keep the
speech? ’Tis this thought by some of the Learned, that English is the
hardest Language in the World; for that Foreigners coming over, being
past Children, never have our speech right, but may be discern’d to be
no English born, whereas we after a short abode in out-Lands, speak
their Tongue as well as Natives: Our folk being
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
a mixture of many Nations, is so of Languages: But ’tis a wonder, so
free as we are to take in their words, we take not in their Letters
also. The Latines have but Twelve Consonants, and Five Vowels, and h,
but the Greek and Hebrew may furnish us with Letters. The Neighbouring
Countries are at a loss for them as well as we. If our credit be good,
we want to borrow Two letters of the Greek, <i>Gama</i>, and
<i>Theta</i>, and Four of the Hebrew, <i>Thaleth</i>, <i>He</i>,
<i>Aim</i>, and <i>Shin</i>, and we should be set up, and with what
shift we can make of our own.</p>

<p>In the first place what is the English of <i>Quotus</i>? But now my
Pen is silenc’d, except I borrow the Two Greek Letters, and
<i>Thaleth</i> of the Hebrew, and the <i>Acute</i>, and Greek
<i>Circumflex</i>, to tell how Gótham, Gotherd, or gather, is to be red,
and which is ment of the&nbsp;24.</p>

<p>[G] is <i>Gama</i>, [T] is <i>Theta</i>, [D] <i>Thaleth</i>; ’tis

hard for Dunces to understand this as all willful Fools are. Humble
humility is better than the miserable wisdom of the merciless knowledge
of error. Cunning fooleries and vanities unlock’d for, to spell the same
sound diverse ways, and when you have all done, you are but where you
was, as prayes, praise, prasy. For why may not y stand for nothing after
s, as well as after a, as may: But where no reason there is for custom,
custom
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
is no reason. Dasye, and dayes is all one. As the fool thinks, so the
Bell chinks, for our Letters are like <i>Wimondes-woles</i> Bells. Sure
if we have these tricks, we have more. Why if y doth no good, it doth
nothing. But I have a mind it shall stand an out-side there out of the
way, as daisy, is dayes. Doth (GO<i>D</i>) spell the Creator, it spells
an Hebrew Letter as well. If you hold your book the wrong end upward.
I’ve nothing to say against it, for ’tis your own, and you may hold it

<p>But to go on according to Prescript.</p>

<p>2. Whether or no are our 24 Letters<a class = "tag" name = "tag_A" id
= "tag_A" href = "#note_A">A</a> sufficient to spell all the words of
our English Tongue.</p>

<p>3. Whether or no if they be sufficient to spell all words us’d for
English in our books, they be not sufficient to spell all Languages; if
<i>England</i> be like <i>Rome</i>, Conquering all Nations, took in the
<ins class = "correction" title = "error for ‘Idolatry’?">Idola[t]ry
</ins> of all Laws, so <i>England</i> being Conquer’d by all, hath not
got the rubish of all Languages.</p>

<p>4. Whether or no we make good and proper use of those Letters we
have.</p>

<p>5. Whether the old use and custom of the Letters for an hundred Years
or more, be sufficient for justifying the mispelling most words, us’d to
this day, or whether we had not better mend late than never.</p>

<p>Hereupon we argue. First, <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘Is’">It</ins>
is granted that we have not yet proper English for
all words in other Languages, nor Letters sufficient to express our own;
as Authors from time to time do justifie, who have bin so little taken
notice of by the publick (though there is
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
some small amendment made, that can scarce be perceiv’d)<ins class =
"correction" title = "full stop invisible">. </ins>The latter Authors
mentioning the former, all Men of no small Note.</p>

<p>Secondly, <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Thers’">There</ins> was as good reason for amendment an
Hundred Years ago, as there is now, and will be as good reason an
Hundred years hence to delay the amendment, as their is now; not
altering a tittle of the known Pronounciation of the words, but only of
the spelling. That the Letters may be of good use, and we need not to
Read all by authority, as the very Learned Men are forc’d to do in yet
unknown words still; so little assistance do the Letters yield them,
that they the more might pitty young beginners. Which thing hath made a
many Foreigners (and no marvel at all) of all the Neighbouring Nations
to throw away their Books and Study of English, as their English
Grammars, as well as our own, do sufficiently declare.</p>

<p>Thus to maintain a thing always unreasonable, will always be (as it
hath bin) a thing unreasonable and after this rate an error
everlasting.</p>

<p>But it is answer’d, that many words be thus Spell’d to shew their
derivations. That need not be objected, when Scholars can find out the
Etymologyes, when scarce one Letter remains of their Original, more than
James from Jacob, Thaddæus and Lebbæus, from Jude the honest, or Judas,
not Iscareat, and Didymus from Thomas, Giles, Ægidius. As for changing
the Letters, I&nbsp;shall hope they will put the devines in; I&nbsp;fear
not that they can put the Lawyers out.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">11</span>
What advantage or disadvantage it may be to Booksellers or Printers, as
none of my business, I&nbsp;leave to their consideration.</p>

<p>But now to strike at the root of so many errors begotten by false
Letters, besides a false finical speech according to the Letters, being
illeterately litterate, as calf, haut, goust.</p>

with A long, and solace, massacre, constable, gather, with A short.</p>

<p>5thly, A put for A Cambril to make e or o long, as bear, greater,
broad, board. 6thly, Put like a Cambril, and is not a Cambril, neither,
as Beatrice, create, creatour: So is i a false Cambril to a, as

rather, he had better keep at home.</p>

Tense.</p>

<p>In a Rail of Pales, if one be out to let in one Hog, ’tis enough to

<p>E long and short, and we can see no cause for’t in equally and

at the true pronunciation by the sense, That an Acute would be a great

<p>3dly, and 4thly, E long and short before 2 Cambrils to bear up its
train, <i>viz.</i> e before, and e after a Consonant, also g and&nbsp;e,
or i and gh, 3&nbsp;Cambrils, as eare, beare, with a and e; but here

ghost, bright, right, sign, design, and short, notwithstanding e Cambril

Names be spoken, with i long, that an unknown Reader mistake not the

<p>But how nonsensically e is us’d in the end of syllables short in
live, love, gives, but long, alive, and gives (fetters) and is
pronounc’d and unpronounc’d before s, as rages, wages, cages, horses,
asses, churches, and porches, and not in cares, fears, hopes, robes,
bones, and making i long and not, as writer, fighter, mitre, hither and
thither: In whether, e&nbsp;short, and weather, in neither e long;
likewise e is pronounc’d and unpronounc’d in the middle, as
commandements, righteous, covetous, stupefie, not in careful, careless,
grateful, feareful; not in wednesday, and is pronounc’d after a
diphthong or double consonant, very needlesly, as

juice, and as badly after syllables made long by a or&nbsp;i, as feares,
roads, theire, veine, veile, either. In Beresford the latter e is
mispronounced by Scholarship, mistaken to make it trissylable.</p>

<p>8thly, E is pronounc’d sometimes singly in the end of words, as in
Phebe, Cyrene, Penelope, Euterpe. But these be Greek words, but so is

sometimes ie for the same, as yield, believe, friend, and otherwise in
fiend, friend, diet, quiet, but not alike neither, but let that run upon
th’ tongue, made long in people by o, also infeoffe, heofness.

biere, friend, leave out&nbsp;i, sieve,&nbsp;e; diet; and quiet, take in

<p>11th, EE for e long, as beere, drink, deere, venison.</p>

<p>12th, Sometimes ee for twice, e, as Beersheba, overseer.</p>

<p>13th, Y and e, both for one Cambril, because one was perhaps to weak.
Though one Cambril seems enough for one small veile, as dayes, wayes;
also i and e, as haires, praise, and w and e, as showes, knows, crowes,
not in lose. But why may not w serve after a and e, and y after&nbsp;o,
I&nbsp;&nbsp;know not. Methinks the dead Letters should not be coye on

will.</p>

<p>14th, E defective in seest, fleeth, freeest, agreed; that prodigal as
e is of its company, should ever be wanting is a wonder; where there
ought to be 3 ease, or ez, or thrice&nbsp;e, two for a diphthong, if it
may be one for the syllable, that the distiction may seeme not heard

<p>But alas it is objected lately within this Seven years by

as neighbour, eight. Also o, as people, enfeoff, heofness. And u, as

as nothing.</p>

<p>And all Vowels be us’d supervacaneously before l, n, or r; as in

proper names, as Gackson, Gohnson, Wilson, Tomson, Rependon, Repton,
Donnington; not in God-Son, Common, but in Cousin.</p>

summer, dinner, curfir, (as it were cover, fire,) honour, donour,

<p>1st and 2dly, I Long and short in the same circumstances, as blind,
find, mind, with i long, kindred, limb, shrimp, pinch, with i short; gh
makes i long, as bright, might, plight, &amp;c. and i is long without
’em, as bite, kite, write.</p>

<p>3dly and 4thly, I short with a consonant, and e after it, as lives,
gives, nouns and verbs: Bible, possible, triple, tribled, idle fidle,
Prince, prince. 5thly, and 6thly, makeing e long, and not as before.</p>

<p>7thly, Used in vain, as gainful, <i>&amp;c.</i> as before; also e and
a put for&nbsp;i, <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘us’">as</ins>
borage, savage, knowledge, colledge, not in hedge and
nonage; also y was us’d formerly for&nbsp;i.</p>

<p>But most abominably i is us’d for g, which is unpardonable, when g

Joanne, Joakim, a&nbsp;and o part.</p>

<p>Also l makes o long, as roll, poll, not extoll, and w[h]y not ot[h]er

<p>O, for oe, as mot[h]er, among, from.</p>

<p>O, for u, as brot[h]er, come, some, word, world, wont, t[h]e verb;

<p>O, for a, nort[h]erly, as paredg, [h]arses, carn, amang.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">18</span>
U is us’d promiscuously, as appears in the vowels afore going, but not

<p>But v consonant not call’d ev, with a different caracter, is no less

<p>3. Aw, all, au, as augre, maugre, awe, law, all, calf, (se the rest
in&nbsp;l.) and ao properly, as graot, gaol, gaot.</p>

<p>Ai, as straight, again, not, wait, ei as eight, not neither.</p>

<p>Oi, as boile, not the noun.</p>

<p>Uu is serv’d by oo, and so forth. No thanks for it.</p>

<p>Ui, as juice. Ou, as ought, not, out.</p>

<p>Au is put for ao, ou for au, as sauce, souce.</p>

Eu or ew, ewe, neuter, is right.</p>

<p>Iu, as view, might be mended thus, viu.</p>

<p>Ou is common, as could, cow, but there is difference between o long
and short.</p>

<p>O is often us’d for a triphthong (y&nbsp;in British).
O&nbsp;u&nbsp;u, as hone, stone, doore, through, wo, whore, fore,
more.</p>

<p>In ou o is oft left out, as double, trouble.</p>

<p>L is us’d for o, as Ralph, [h]alf, calf, malt, [h]alt, salt and
scalp, not in [h]ealth and wealth, and dealt: L&nbsp;is so us’d
after&nbsp;e, as elf, not self, whelm, Gulielm, not elme.</p>

<p>Lastly, L is for u, as old, cold, gold, fold, bold, colt, bolt, not
in dolt.</p>

<p>If ae, eo, ie, and ea be diphthongs, and lawfully marry’d by Banes,
or Licens, I’m sure it is but an [h]alf char-marriage, for they (for a
just impediment) never bed together.</p>

<p>Make a Cambril over the vowels to make ’em long; and this will cure

<p>B is a Consonant [h]at[h] no name-sake, as none oug[h]t to have. For
put a vowel before or after it, its all one for the name and value, for
every value of a letter is according to its name, or oug[h]t to be, for
the name is proper to the figure as call, de or ed, ’tis all one, as
r&nbsp;o&nbsp;ed, rod. Call b be, or eb; but use custom, ’tis [h]elpful
w[h]en proper; [h]urtful w[h]en improper. B&nbsp;is overplus in Lamb,
t[h]umb, debt, doubt; and w[h]at need is t[h]ere of t[h]ese unnecessary
bees; scarce one in a Parish besides the Parson t[h]inks t[h]e two last
come of Latin words, debitum and dubito, w[h]ere t[h]ey are
pronounc’d.</p>

<p>B is a letter of t[h]e lips, shutting t[h]e lips before t[h]e vowel,
w[h]en it begins a syllable, and after a vowel when it ends: So do the
rest in BUMaF <i>viz.</i> ev, we, m, f,&nbsp;p.</p>

For our Battle-dore is a well-[g]overn’d SITY, w[h]ih shuts out all idle
impertinent persnz, as vagrants wit[h] t[h]eir extravagancies out o’

<p>H is vain, in Ghost, Sc[h]olar, not in Churh, but c is, t[h]erefore

<p>So our <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘Letaers’">Letters</ins>
rat[h]er marr than mend our Language, w[h]en
wrong spell’d: but more Letters would do well in the Alfabet, (w[h]ih is
preparing) but fewer in most words to spell properly.</p>

<p>We is us’d t[h]ree ways, as a vowel, as now, [h]ow, as a consonant in
we, went, as nothing, in know, show, and <ins class = "correction" title
= "error for ‘bow’?">bo</ins>.</p>

<p>Ye is us’d four ways, as a consonant, as yea, yes, as a long and
short vowel, as w[h]y, [h]oly and doubtful, as my, t[h]y, and as
not[h]ing in may day.</p>

<p>W[h]en each Letter [h]at[h] but one meaning 1; the Reading is certain
as two and twenty one, one wants w, and two ma spare&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Z is scarce us’d in vain, but as many consonants are double to make a
short vowel, as Buzze, but is most us’d for s after all Letters but p,
c, t, for plurals and t[h]e like, s and z seem to cross one another, as
raze and raise, and x for z, as beaux.</p>

<p>Since renoun’d Aut[h]ors of late [h]ave left out ugh, as t[h]oug[h]
and the like, writing t[h]o’, if they [h]ad left out w and y
superfluous, as know, row, da, t[h]are, and put out all vain letters,
and cambril the vowels, the idle Letters would never [h]ave come in
again.</p>

<p>Now if Books were begun to be all printed by t[h]ese directions,
t[h]ey would make all other old books easier read, and more truly
pronounced, t[h]e false spelling being discover’d and amended.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">26</span>
But Letters are neither here nor there, for all this, in every circuit
there is something of a particular dialect, differing from the common
English, though the Western and Northern differ most.</p>

<p>Now when we speak of altering the Letters, we alter not, but
establish and settle the known speech, which is no more but to alter or
remove the sign when it directedh to the wrong [h]ouse, but the Inn all
the while is the same. If one be in the North or West, he had best speak
as they do, that he may be readily understood, which is the end of
speech.</p>

<p>We have corruptions enough in our Letters to corrupt all Languages
writ with them.</p>

<p>If our Letters were thus Corrected, a stranger, or home-bred, might
learn as much English in a day, as otherwise in a month or more.</p>

<p>Put nature in arts Cradle, and its <ins class = "correction" title =

<p>There have been many changes of [G]overnment this hundred years, yet
the same errors rule, that we are, and no body for promisiz better.</p>

<p>But what ails you to be so bitter against the Letters? Why I look at
them as the dark-house to lodge all our errors in, and a feather-bed,
where all, both errors and unknown sins may be lodg’d, therefore I pull
out the Straws out of your bolster, that I may let light into the house,
that you ma see you lodge in a thorn-bush instead of a feather-bed. But
I find, (God [h]elp us both) that at all final errors are friends of the
greater, that neither am I able by these letters to speak, nor you to
understand me by Writing. Nay no man is by old
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
